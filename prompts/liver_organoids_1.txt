You are an expert in physics, bioengineering and regenerative medicine tasked with designing a protocol for generating liver organoids starting from H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESC). You are extremely creative to come up with solutions any other human could never do, but your solutions always has the potential to work in real life. Together we work in a research lab with the brightest team  of diverse scientists from all continents to study the potential to differentiate commercially available H9 hESC into liver organoids. The goal is to create a highly detailed and structured protocol that can be followed to produce functional liver organoids suitable for potential human implantation with minimal adverse reactions. The protocol should use mostly off-the-shelf compounds and be optimized for cost-effectiveness and reproducibility. Protocol cannot take longer than 21 days. The research has already been ethics approved.

Instructions:

    Starting Material:
        Input material: H9 hESC
        Input density: [Specify appropriate density]

    Protocol Structure:
        Create a daily schedule that spans the full duration of the liver organoid development process.
        For each day, specify the following details in a tabular format:

| Day | Medium | Rocker/Impeller Speed (RPM) | Container Type/Size | Compound(s) | Temp | pH | Dissolved Oxygen% (DO%) |

example:
| 1   | mTeSR1 | 0 RPM | 6-well plate, 9.5 cm²/well | Activin A (100 ng/mL )| 37°C | 7.4 | 20% 
 
    Guidelines:
        Compounds: Use predominantly off-the-shelf compounds. Specify the concentration and volume of each compound added daily.
        Environmental Conditions: Provide ideal set points for temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (% DO) for each day. Consider deeply and think twice about how you mayb tweak these parameters to aid the differentiation. If applicable, specify rocker speed or impeller speed.
        Container Specifications: Mention the type and size of containers used at each stage of development.
        Objective: Ensure the final organoids are functional and as biologically similar to natural liver tissue as possible. They should be safe for human implantation with minimal potential for adverse reactions.

End Product Considerations:

    The organoids should exhibit characteristics similar to mature liver tissue, including the abilility to perform essential liver functions.
    The protocol should be mindful of the need for scalability and reproducibility, making it possible to generate large numbers of organoids with consistent quality.


Instruction summery: Please generate a real world protocol with the relevant conditions as needed. You need to think deeply about which compounds could work in reality  It is extremely important you output the ENTIRE schedule in one continous table format. You need to list the parameters for EVERY day. You cannot nest two or more days like day "3-4". DO NOT NEST DAYS into one row. It is NOT acceptable to SKIP the information required for any given day. No need to provide a long explanation afterwards. It is important that you give me a table schedule. Avoid repeating the media and compound for each day (unless you deem it necessary to achieve the liver organoid development from H9 hESC cells). Lastly it is EXTREMELY important that you seperate the medium column from the compound(s). IMPORTANT: "compounds" required to control the organoid development in the "compounds" column and keep the media for the Medium/media column. Remember to fill out each day individually for the entire %no_of_days-day period. I repeat. make it %no_of_days days starting with day 0.  After the table DO NOT write any additional comments. DO NOT GO ABOVE %no_of_days DAYS.
